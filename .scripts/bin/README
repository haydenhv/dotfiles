Hey, thanks for downloading my path scripts. However, there are some things you may want to consider before picking and choosing some scripts.

To install the scripts, copy them to your PATH. If you are not sure how to setup a path, download my .profile from my dotfiles, and place it in your home directory. Now, place the scripts in .scripts/bin/

Some of the scripts will simply be wrappers on each other, please make sure that scripts such as dmpv have access to dfm.
